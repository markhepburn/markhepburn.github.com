<p>Following the Gastown jaunt we continued through Chinatown for a bit. I didn't actually realise until my last day in town that there was actually a whole back area of Chinatown that looked much more fun, that we didn't cover this walk (more of the bustling streets, rather than the gardens and more formal aspects). Oh well. <p /> Anyway. Half the photos are of the Sun Yat Sen gardens; the Chinese zodiac paving is just a sample from the full set, arranged in a circle in the courtyard outside the gardens. The tank in the last picture is actually a few blocks away on the edge of downtown, and there's actually two of them... go figure! (war memorials, I believe)</p>
