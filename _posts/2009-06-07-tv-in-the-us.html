40-odd channels, and nothing to watch.  The ads are quite revealing though; I think you can break them down into 3 categories that the majority seem to fall into:<br /><ul><li>Weight-loss and related (diabetes medication, etc)</li>
<li>Disgusting-looking fast food</li><li>Debt-related (debt management, bankruptcy, etc)</li></ul>Actually, related to that first one, you can probably break a separate category: drugs.  I&#39;ve seen heaps, and they&#39;re quite detailed in their disclaimers too (&quot;see your doctor if an erection lasts 4 hours or more&quot;).<p />
So, basically: things relating to over-indulgence, and pills to fix it.
