title: Wellington Falls via Milles Track
published: true

<p>My last trip was to Wellington Falls. The conditions seemed ideal: we'd had a week of rain ensuring the falls should be gushing, followed by a couple of days of glorious sunshine and clear skies for walking. Not only did it deliver, but I didn't even encounter a single other person the entire time! <p /> You can see my earlier visit to the falls via the Cathedral Rock circuit <a href="http://everythingtastesbetterwithchilli.com/cathedral-rock-montague-thumbs-wellington-fal">here</a>; apart from that route I thought the only approach was via the fairly sedate pipeline track. As it turns out there's a track from the Springs along Milles Track, which is both more direct and more picturesque, with nice views of Cathedral Rock and Montague Thumbs when the cover opens up a bit. About half way along you encounter the "Potato Fields", which is quite a large sprawling boulder field the track passes over. <p /> <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=205040447772818809079.000499fe012994b9323be&amp;ll=-42.923372,147.22229&amp;spn=0.085603,0.111065&amp;z=13">Track available here</a>.</p>
