*Sorry for the delay!  A while ago
[I mentioned]({% post_url 2013-12-22-north-america-2013-back-to-vancouver %})
I had quit my job to attempt something with a friend; we suddenly
found ourselves with a lot of work, which has curtailed blogging a
fair bit.  I have an ever-growing list of non-travel posts to write,
long and short, technical and otherwise, so future travel updates
might be rather brief as I try and clear the slate first.*

# On to Los Angeles

One of the great pleasures of travelling... is meeting other
travellers, who can then help you out on your *next* journey!  And so
it was; the year before in Patagonia I had met 3 Los Angeles
residents: Kevin, understated but with immense resolve (hiking
Patagonia while needing both knee and shoulder surgery) and one of the
most thoroughly decent men you would ever meet; his friend and
counterpoint Dan, ebullient and a brilliant (and constant) story
teller; and a beautiful Czech lady with fascinating tales mixing old
communist Czechoslovakia and modern Hollywood, Zdenka.  A year later I
was determined to catch up with all of them again, so despite the city
itself having no other appeal to me at the time, it was my obvious next
stop.

Dan was out of the country again, but it was great meeting Kevin again
and spending more time with him, sharing another hike in the mountains
behind LA.  Then from suburbia outside LA (an hour and a half of
freeway traffic outside, which just appears to be a standard commute),
I spent a couple of days in the trendy-hippy beach towns of
Venice/Santa Monica with Zdenka, seeing a completely different side of
the area.

# Yosemite

In so far as I had any plan for this trip, it was to spend roughly 2
months going East across Canada then back West across the US, seeing
mostly cities, before touring as much of the amazing national parks on
offer in America during my final month.  To date I was on schedule,
and in yet another display of generosity Kevin loaned me his
[truck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_F-Series).  Swallowing my
nerves about driving on the other side of the road---I'd overcome some
fear in [Alberta]({% post_url 2013-12-27-stunning-alberta %}), but
Californian freeways were another matter entirely---I made a
last-minute hostel booking and drove 7 hours up to Yosemite.

The next day, the
[US Government Shutdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_shutdown_in_the_United_States)
closed the national parks.

Ok, that was a slight exaggeration for dramatic effect.  The reality
is the next day I had a full day of hiking up to the (bone-dry)
Yosemite Falls, where I had lunch overlooking the incredible valley
view and watching crows joy-riding the thermal off the cliff edge.

The *next* day they really did close the parks.  No-one had any idea
what that was going to mean in practice however, so together with an
Irish dorm-mate (are Irish ever not great travellers?) we drove in to
try our luck.  The ranger at the gate also seemed unclear what the
shutdown entailed,[^1] but said we could go in "today".  From the sounds
of it we just got lucky; others were supposedly turned away, while
others were allowed in but later evicted by different rangers.  This
was a Tuesday, and at that time people expected things to be resolved
by Thursday---no doubt the parties of the 6 weddings apparently
planned inside the park that weekend were particularly hopeful, as
well as the climbers with months-long camping plans who were being
told to leave.

Still, we counted our blessings and enjoyed a much quieter hike to
Vernal and Nevada Falls.  There was no way I wasn't taking advantage
of any break---only the day before I'd optimistically paid for a
year-long national-parks pass, and the chances of breaking even on my
investment by visiting 4 parks were now looking rather slim.
