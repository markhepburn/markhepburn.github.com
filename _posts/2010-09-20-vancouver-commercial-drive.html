Commercial Drive, a stretch of road up the east end of Broadway (and adjacent blocks) is apparently a bit of an icon and alternative culture type scene, but somehow I'd never been there before. I almost missed out this trip as well, and although I left it a bit late and only had time for a quick visit I'm glad I did. <p /> Not much in the way of photos, but lots of cool graffiti, cafes, alternative shops, etc.
