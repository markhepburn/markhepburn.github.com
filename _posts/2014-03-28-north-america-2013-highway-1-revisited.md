With my plans for a national parks tour dashed, and the situation
looking unlikely to be resolved anytime soon, I had to make other
plans.  On the plus side I now had the opportunity to visit a number
of other places on the West Coast, places I previously thought I
wouldn't have time for.

So, rather than heading inland a bit we made a beeline back West to
the coast.  I dropped my Irish hiking buddy off in San Francisco, and
headed south to the old capital of
[Monterey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey).

# Monterey

Monterey was a curious mix; a very touristy small town centre, and
otherwise a very relaxed beach-town feel.  One of the big attractions
is its world-famous [aquarium](http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/)
and associated research institute, on my radar from my previous life
in another [marine research centre](http://www.cmar.csiro.au/).  To be
honest, I found the aquarium amazing and incredibly well done, but
definitely aimed at children.

# Big Sur

Just South of Monterey is
[Big Sur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Sur), a coastal area with
steep mountains of redwood forest, rising straight up from the ocean.
I was planning on moving there next, but having left it to the last
minute (a recurring theme) and with no camping gear I decided to stay
on in Monterey and just drive down to Big Sur for day trips.

The first day was actually somewhat of a let-down.  I began by taking
the much-hyped
[17-mile drive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17-Mile_Drive); basically
a gated-commune of golf courses and beaches just outside Monterey.
You pay to drive around, and occasionally take photos through the
bus-tour crowds while Kenny Rogers plays on some oblivious gentleman's
iPad.  Avoid; if you drive just a little further you get much better
views, for free.  Then it was lunch-time, deep in Big Sur at the also
over-hyped and even more over-priced
[Nepenthe](http://www.nepenthebigsur.com/) (I was at least prepared
for the cost).  I did at least manage a short walk, up through
redwoods to a pleasant but unremarkable view. The second day started
much more promisingly at the iconic
[McWay Falls](http://www.hikinginbigsur.com/hikes_mcwayfalls.html),
the only coastal waterfall in California.  After that I went on a
steep hike up the mountains behind it, with a rewarding view at the
summit dropping right down to the water.

As an aside[^1]: I've been a fan of the author
[Jack Kerouac](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140283293/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0140283293&linkCode=as2&tag=evertastbettw-20),
and it seemed appropriate to
[read more](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140042520/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0140042520&linkCode=as2&tag=evertastbettw-20)
while road-tripping.  Fittingly, there's even one *called*
[Big Sur](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143119230/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0143119230&linkCode=as2&tag=evertastbettw-20),
so that was night-time reading for this part of the journey.  It is,
however... rather dark, I warn you!  Gone is the carefree and
foot-loose innocence, and all that's left is a descent into alcoholism
and depression as he struggles with fame and worries he's losing his
mind.  It put a bit more of a sombre mood on this leg than I was
planning on.

# Highway 1

Then it was time to leave Monterey for good, one last time through Big
Sur and keep going down that amazing coastline to LA again.  It is a
single-lane highway but obviously very popular, and steering the
enormous truck I was driving around blind corners knowing how many
cycle tourers were around got quite nerve-wracking.

Yet again though I realised how charmed I'd been with the weather: a
heavy fog completely blanketed the ocean all morning, making for a
great change in atmosphere as I drove down, but probably less
appealing for anyone on their first trip.  Even the McWay Falls were
completely obscured as I drove past, thanking my luck for the perfect
weather I'd had the previous 2 days as I did so!

Once the views have eased off a little, your next stop is likely to be
[Hearst Castle](http://hearstcastle.org/).  This place is hard to
describe: from the reception building you are escorted up to the
castle itself by coach.  It's a bizarre mix of old and new; built
within the last century, but with most of the interior coming from the
antiques collection of (the late) William Hearst.  He even had a
private zoo at the time; I saw a herd of zebras, still roaming around,
as I was leaving!

I stopped for a couple of nights in San Luis Obispo.  It was a small
town, pleasant to wander without making undue demands, and in my case
a nice communal hostel to stay in.

I made another stop in Santa Barbara.  Many people talk about how
great it is, and I suspect it would be a fantastic place to live.  As
it was, I drove in through the opulent strip, stayed in a motel on
the beach which turned out to be fairly unexciting, and left the next
morning rather underwhelmed.  The one saving grace was Dan linking me
up with a good friend of his, who was kind enough to meet up and show
me a few of the watering holes, giving me some inkling of life in the
area.  Perhaps next time!
