A shorter-than-intended (left it a bit late leaving, and it's a long way from home!) walk at Mt Field. The first shot is a token one from Russell Falls, which is a paved 10 minute walk from the car park. <p /> The main walk is a loop starting from Lake Dobson, which is a 20 minute drive above Russell Falls. It climbs up briefly through a pandani grove before hitting alpine territory, with some spectacular vistas (wait for the panoramas to be posted separately). Didn't get too far into it unfortunately; next time when I'm more organised perhaps. Just (it was scurrying under the board-walk) caught an echnidna on the return trip.<ol>
