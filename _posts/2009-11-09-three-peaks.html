(but not <a href="http://www.threepeaks.org.au/">those three peaks</a>).  This weekend&#39;s adventures: a loop in Collinsvale, climbing Collin&#39;s Bonnet, Trestle Mountain, and Collin&#39;s Cap.  The track can be seen <a href="http://maps.google.com.au/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=100350378063614321893.000477c708ec6258670a0&amp;t=h&amp;z=14">here</a>.  Hmm, let&#39;s see what Posterous does with a track link:<br /> <iframe scrolling="no" marginheight="0" class="google-map" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com.au/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=100350378063614321893.000477c708ec6258670a0&t=h&output=embed" frameborder="0" height="400" width="500"></iframe><br />
            <a href="http://maps.google.com.au/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=100350378063614321893.000477c708ec6258670a0&t=h&source=embed">View Larger Map</a><p /> There&#39;s the usual GPS inaccuracies, including stopping short of the actual finishing point; what looks like an off-track detour to Trestle mountain though is actually correct, as the track in the guide (and on the map) was closed for re-vegetation).<p /> As you can tell from the photos, it was a spectacular day (note to self: 1200ml of water is probably not enough on a hot day.  Also, I got a bit burnt).  It&#39;s a really nice area, too.  It starts in Myrtle forest with a small water falls shortly along the track, then quickly climbs out of that and through Eucalyptus scrub into alpine.  There&#39;s two panoramas from Collin&#39;s Bonnet area; one just below the peak, and one from the peak.<p /> Trestle Mountain is accessible off a fire trail, and has some awesome rock formations up the top (panorama included), as well as great views back to the Bonnet.<p />Collin&#39;s Cap is via another intersecting fire trail, and is a fairly popular walk from the Myrtle track where I started.  Thankfully, no-one was there by the time I got there!  In the final panorama you can see Collin&#39;s Bonnet on the left, and Trestle Mountain to the right.  (Hmm, gmail is dying trying to attach that last one -- I might have to upload that separately)
