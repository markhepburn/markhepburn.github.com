<p>Near the Oriental Studies Centre in UBC is a Japanese garden area, and amongst that is the Nitobe gardens (which you need to pay to get in). They're quite nice, but most of my photos were over-exposed unfortunately. <p /> Typically, there's lots of symbolism present (they give you a guide sheet so you can interpret it, and, err, know it's there in the first place). There's roughly 13 stone lanterns, representing different phases in life, with the paths of course connecting them. For example, there's a "path of teenage rebellion" (it's a dead-end. Very subtle).</p>
