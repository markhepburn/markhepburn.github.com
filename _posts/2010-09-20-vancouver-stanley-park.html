Last day in Vancouver, and a final visit to Stanley park before my flight in the evening. <p /> I loved the couple trying to emulate the pose of the "mermaid" statue (it's actually "girl in a wetsuit", but I don't think it anyone calls it that), although I suspect there's quite a few attempts like that!
