I spent a week in Sydney over the new year. There was walking. This particular lot is from around the coastal track around Garie Beach, in the Royal National Park. Fantastic weather (rain had been predicted!) as you can see, and for those of you expecting it -- yes, I attempted a panorama, but it was so a-kilter that I haven't even bothered stitching it, sorry.
