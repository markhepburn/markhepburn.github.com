Once upon a time I would have prided myself for being on top of a
sizeable portion of the internet, at least in the
[breaking](http://www.reddit.com/)-[nerd](http://news.ycombinator.com/)-[news](http://slashdot.org/)
sphere.  Lately, again and again I keep stumbling across memes that
seem to have been entrenched for ages, but of which I was blissfully
ignorant.[^1] Case in point: I only just heard about
[doge](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge).  (Boy am I impressed by
the thoroughness of research behind
[knowyourmeme.com](http://knowyourmeme.com/) though!)

I'm not sure what to make of it, but I suspect it means I've been more
productive recently.

[^1]: Some just seem simply
[stupid](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/harlem-shake) too, but that's
probably me getting old.
