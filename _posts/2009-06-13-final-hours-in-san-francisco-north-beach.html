I ended up blowing off the last session of WWDC on Friday in order to have one final walk around, choosing North Beach which is the Italian quarter (and right above Chinatown, which is where the first pic is from, on my way there). <p />&nbsp;I started with another Lonely Planet walking tour, which actually focussed on the former haunts of the "beat generation": pic #2 is "Jack Kerouac Lane", and on its right is the City Lights bookshop, which was quite cool for a quick browse. Most of the rest of the pictures are just random, but fairly typical SF shots: I swear I must have over 100 that all look like that now!). <p />&nbsp;Also, I found the SF Tricycle! (also pictured) And thank god too, because after a week of forcing down vats of pre-brewed "Starbucks coffee" from the convention -- in fact, I even went without for a couple of days -- I was almost off the habit. I am now espresso'd up again, I am sure you will be relieved to hear. <p />&nbsp;After that, I made it to the airport with plenty of time to spare, and finally got through customs etc in Vancouver about 11pm. More to follow..
