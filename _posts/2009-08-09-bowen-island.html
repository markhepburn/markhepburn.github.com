Last weekend I made a short trip to Bowen Island, which is a small island about 20 minutes away by ferry. It was quite pretty (also, stinking hot that day), and for some reason apparently has a huge British population: it was almost disconcerting when a shopkeeper had a British accent! <p />&nbsp;Not much else to say. Sample photos attached.
