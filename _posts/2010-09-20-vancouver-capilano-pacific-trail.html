<p>Probably my only regret about this trip is not getting "outdoors" enough, which was partly due to having to rely on public transport, and mainly because I just wasn't that organised (this is a bit of a theme of the trip unfortunately!). I was desperate to do a bit of trekking though, and settled on the Capilano trail, which is accessible on the same bus route that goes to Grouse Mountain. <p /> It's certainly set in spectacular surrounds, and starts on a dam. The walk itself is quite pleasant, but the trail is very easy -- would be great for running though. It eventually breaks into suburbia again, and although it eventually crossed through down to a river again I wasn't convinced that it was going to get any more interesting and turned back. This was probably a mistake as I think it actually went all the way to the inlet and I wasn't that far from the end, but I was short of time as well. <p /> On the way back I detoured through a few side trails, including -- more by good luck than any recollection of the map -- stumbling across "Grandpa Capilano", a 61m cedar.</p>
