<p>There was a <a href="http://www.harmonyarts.ca">music and arts festival</a> in West Vancouver the last week or two, and I went to a couple of concerts. One was Jim Brynes, who I've mentioned before; the other was a local fusion group called <a href="http://www.delhi2dublin.com/">Delhi 2 Dublin</a>, which featured Bhangra, Celtic-style fiddle, and a Nepalese guy in a kilt playing electric sitar. <br />&nbsp;<br />I actually got their album off emusic and it's solid if not spectacular; they were great live though, even in front of a fairly staid crowd (as you may be able to guess if you can make out much in front of the stage). Tongue in cheek quote from the MC, to requests for another encore: "you can cheer all you want, but this is West Van and we close at 9pm" :)</p>
