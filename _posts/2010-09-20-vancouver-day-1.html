<p>(For those that weren't aware, I was back in Vancouver for a fortnight to attend a wedding and catch up with friends). <p /> Day 1 was an easy wander around, re-orienting myself. I visited Granville "Island" again, on the left in the panorama (taken from the North end of Granville bridge, with Burrard bridge on the right), before catching up with the future groom in the harbour on the other side of down-town. All of this was actually different, put in place for the winter Olympics (that's the torch pictured). Not sure what the significance of the "pixelated" killer whale is but it looks cool, "do not climb" sign not withstanding!</p>
