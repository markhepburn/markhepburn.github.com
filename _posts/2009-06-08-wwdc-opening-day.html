<p>Sub-titled: well, that almost sucked. When I registered yesterday, I <br />was told that the doors would be opening at 7, but that people would <br />be getting there earlier (for a keynote that started at 10). Then I <br />went to a reception with people saying they'd be getting there by 3 or <br />4. There was no way I was doing this, and figured I could turn up <br />some time shy of 9, be at the back of the queue and still get a seat. <br />As it was... the queue was still stretching right around the corner, <br />and with more people still arriving eventually wrapped around a second <br />corner. We didn't get to move for ages, until almost 10, and when we <br />finally got to the door some guy actually stopped the queue at me <br />until his mate said they could keep letting people in. I wound up in <br />an overflow room, but honestly don't think it made any difference -- <br />last time I was so far up the back that I ended up watching the whole <br />thing on one of their big screens anyway, and I don't think you miss <br />anything. <br />&nbsp;<br />You can all read about what was announced, etc (even watch the keynote <br />if you really want), and I believe I'm under NDA about the rest of the <br />stuff anyway, so I'll only offer general comments for now. It was <br />actually a bit depressing to begin with. I've been to this conference <br />once before, in 2006 which was building Apple hype and optimism but <br />pre-iphone, and it was great that everyone was happy to talk about <br />what they were doing, etc and just generally excited. This time <br />around... I only spoke to a couple of people, and overheard a few more <br />conversations, but it felt like almost everyone was just pitching <br />their latest shitty iphone app (I dunno, maybe they were all good, but <br />it felt a lot more cynical and like gold-rush fever).</p>
<p>One vaguely fun thing worth mentioning: In the main area they had a large display made up of about a 5x5 cinema display grid, which had the icons of the top 20,000 iphone apps from the store.&nbsp; Every time one of them sold its icon would flash and shake a little.&nbsp; There was a lot of shaking going on!</p>
<p><br />The most obvious sign of this was actually in the queue. There were <br /><em>heaps</em> of people and companies handing out fliers and generally <br />pitching (almost all involving the iphone). There was a solitary guy <br />handing out business-card ads for his "iDrinkulator" (I believe it <br />calculates the calories in what you're drinking), there was a team of <br />people handing out paper advertising their "paperless business-cards" <br />(eco-friendly, apparently), there was a team advertising Symbian <br />development, and most memorably there was a team of girls from <br />"iPorn", on a horse-drawn carriage and just walking around (it was <br />quite a cold morning too; wouldn't have been the easiest money they've <br />ever earned I'm guessing!) <br />&nbsp;<br />And yes, I think I was the only person in the building without an iphone.</p>
