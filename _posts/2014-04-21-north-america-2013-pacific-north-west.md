I was still disappointed not to be on the road and heading east to
[Bryce Canyon](http://www.nps.gov/brca/index.htm),
[Grand Canyon](http://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm),
[Arches](http://www.nps.gov/arch/index.htm),
[Zion](http://www.nps.gov/zion/index.htm), ..., but at least I now had
the time to head north.  My musical awakening as a teenager centred
around Nirvana and the grunge scene so Seattle had always been on my
radar; these days a love of coffee, craft beer, food, and independent
music made Portland an intriguing prospect as well[^1].

So I returned Kevin's truck, spent a few more days in Venice
exploring with friends (celebrated my birthday in Silverlake, went to
an anti-Monsanto rally, and followed up with chicken-and-waffles
breakfast at [Roscoe's](http://roscoeschickenandwaffles.com/)---I
think I've covered LA!), and caught a flight to Portland.

# Portland

I'd booked close to a week in Portland, again to decompress and geek
out a little, and it really didn't disappoint.  By far the most
consistently excellent espresso of any place I'd visited to date, and
just a thoroughly *comfortable* town.  I'm from a small town myself, a
similar distance from the equator, so while the beautiful sunny
weather of the last two months had been great it was still quite nice
to feel a nip in the shade, and even to see the town mostly closed as
I explored on a Sunday.

I really hadn't done a lot of research[^2], and all I knew about
[Powell's Bookshop](http://www.powells.com/) was that it seemed to be
one of the things to do in Portland.  It was only a block from where I
was staying, and I like a good bookshop so on my first morning I
wandered over.

I would not emerge until well after lunchtime.  Powell's, I
discovered, is famous because it's the largest independent bookstore
in the world.  It literally covers an entire block with 4 floors, and
if you wanted the technical books section... well, that's across the
road in another building, the size of most normal bookshops.  They
couldn't fit it in the main store.  Obscure topics (say, "interior
decoration for attics with sloped ceilings") that would barely rate a
mention on Amazon, let alone your radar, in Powell's have multiple
shelves dedicated to them.

I caught a bus up to the
[Rose Gardens](http://www.rosegardenstore.org/rose-gardens.cfm), only
to overshoot the bus stop and find myself speeding past progressively
more distant stops.  Eventually I got off, and on a whim started
walking down a path off the road-side.  It not only went exactly where
I was intending, but soon became a very pleasant
[educational trail](http://www.hoytarboretum.org/)---winning.  The
gardens themselves were picturesque enough and provided a fairly nice
view back out over the city, with Mount Hood just visible behind.

Portland is justifiably famous for its
[food trucks](http://www.foodcartsportland.com/), and many are
excellent (many others, of course, are not).  On my final morning I
made one final trip to an earlier favourite
([the peoples' pig](https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesPig), for
excellent porchetta sandwiches), and my afternoon bus to Seattle came
up in conversation.  They immediately told me about a place for cured
meats called [Salumi](http://www.salumicuredmeats.com/), literally
right next to where I would get off the bus---score!  It even turned
out that the place is run by the father of celebrity chef
[Mario Batali](http://www.mariobatali.com/).

# Seattle

So I rolled into Seattle and made a bee-line for Salumi... in
something of a harbinger of things to come, it was closed (only open
to the public a small number of days, and limited hours).  Undeterred
I checked into my hostel and after a quick chat with room-mates found
a pumping [sports bar](http://belltownpizza.net/) to grab a counter
meal and watch the football game.  The local team won, spirits were
high, and it turned out the people around me were friends with the
owner and we wound up doing quite a few shots.  The night was rosy but
not out of control... until I cheerily rolled back to the hostel, and
agreed to go straight back out again with a room-mate who had itchy
feet.  I fear I may not have fully appreciated the excellent whisky we
wound up drinking.

The next morning my good mood from the night before had deserted me
and so, it was feeling like, had my persistent good luck on this trip.
Slightly underwhelmed by the hostel breakfast I went out, straight
into a thick damp fog making it apparent I didn't have enough warm
clothes on, and I immediately jarred my knee stepping down off the
curb, with my opposite hip already complaining about lugging my
backpack around yesterday.  Feeling slightly sorry for myself I
figured any coffee would help, and ducked into the first half-way
decent looking cafe I came across.  The vile espresso I forced down
had me cursing that decision too, and I was all but ready to either go
back to bed or pass through Seattle entirely.

Like a true soldier though I pushed on, and after exploring the
[Pike Place Markets](http://www.pikeplacemarket.org/) for a while I
emerged into sunshine, with my headache and other pains gone, and
ready to conquer the town.

This time I didn't fail at Salumi, and enjoyed a tasty lunch in a
secluded
[Japanese waterfall-garden](http://www.pioneersquare.org/go/waterfall-garden)
I stumbled upon nearby.

Late in the day I figured I should check out the standard Seattle
cliche, the [Space Needle](http://www.spaceneedle.com/home/).  I
wasn't that excited about it, but for once in my experience of
"queuing to go up tall things", the queues weren't too bad.  Not only
that, but by the time I was up the top the skies were clear and the
light was great... and only then did I realise that if I just stuck
around for another half hour or so I would also get some great sunset
and night-time shots!

# Bellingham

Bellingham was somewhat of a random choice.  An early tip from a
friend (Dan) was to check out the
[San Juan Islands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan_Islands), and
Bellingham was one jumping-off point for exploring them.  Also, and
completely randomly, it's where
[The Postal Service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wrsZog8qXg)
originate from!

An early bus from Seattle unfortunately made such good time that we
were dropped at the terminal an hour early---which was already
scheduled to be about an hour before the first bus into town.  A long
cold wait, two buses and a long walk later and I was at the motel I'd
booked, still hours before check-in time but a very friendly owner let
me grab breakfast and found a vacant room for me (as well as telling
me that the reason they didn't have microwaves was because drug
dealers used cheap hotel rooms as disposable cooking-labs).  I made
another long, grey walk into town, only to find (it was a Sunday
again) almost everything shut.  I did find some passable coffee, and
stumbled upon a water-side path that took me all the way to adjoining
Fairhaven (also shut).  On my return home I took a wrong turn and
wound up passing through the university campus---also scenic, and
rather close to my motel but with no way to cut through so by the time
I got home it had been quite a long day, and I had already seen most
of the town!  I grabbed take-away and started researching ways to
occupy the next couple of days.

This time though, my luck really *had* run out.  Hiring a sea kayak?
Sorry, the season finished last month.  Perhaps whale watching again?
Nope, same story.  A visit to the San Juans?  Actually, it turns out
that you *can't* go directly from Bellingham any more, and my best
option was via Anacortes (the other town I'd been considering), which
would be a 3 hour journey *each way*.  Oh well, it looked like this
was going to be another chill-out stop!  I spent the next day walking
the town, trawling record stores, and hacking in cafes.  My final day
I hired a bike in Fairhaven and hit a trail that eventually cruised
through pine forest along the water's edge, before a steep climb
finished with a short lake circuit hike.

I had one more night back in Seattle before flying back to LA, and
used the time to find the fantastic
[bridge troll](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_Troll) (also,
[Top Pot Donuts](http://www.toppotdoughnuts.com/)).

[^1]: Yes, I am aware this makes me a closet hipster.  Guilty as
     charged... but my legs just aren't skinny enough for their jeans,
     and I refuse to wear plaid, regardless.  Also, my stubble is down
     to laziness, not irony.

[^2]: Apart from Zdenka making me watch a series of
    [Portlandia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portlandia_(TV_series))!
    And yes, apparently that show might as well be a documentary.
