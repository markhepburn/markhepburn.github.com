<p>Another walk around Mt Wellington, this time along Thark Ridge. The plan was to go to Devil's Throne, but as it was I couldn't follow the directions too well (the track was pretty sparse; apparently there was a turn-off somewhere but I think I must have missed it). Looking at how far I got I think I must have past it without realising! I did get to quite a nice lookout at the end though, with nice views to one side of<a href="http://everythingtastesbetterwithchilli.com/cathedral-rock-montague-thumbs-wellington-fal"> Cathedral Rock and Montague Thumbs</a>. <p /> <a href="http://maps.google.com.au/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=100350378063614321893.0004813465e336fbbd55f&amp;t=h&amp;z=15">Track here</a>, if you can figure out where I went better than I did.</p>
