<p>I went to the aquarium (in Stanley park) this weekend, and it was good. If I learned one thing however, it's that I <em>really</em> need a better camera, as almost all photos were blurry and too dark. <br />&nbsp;<br />They have a bunch of tanks of well-lit jelly-fish though which were very cool. The only other photos I'm bothering to include are some token Nemo pictures, and a blurry shark. Sorry about that.</p>
