Apologies; there was a hiccup in posterous last it seems: I sent one email, with attachments, and got two posts, identical apart from one lacking any image gallery. So I deleted the gallery-less one, and... wound up with one post, with no gallery. (and no undo). The original email in gmail doesn't have the attachments either, perhaps because of the volume. so, anyway, here's the first lot of photos, again. Fingers crossed.

<div data-album="5750538814005118817" class="gallery"><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/110262280296887306226/20091109PhotosTake2Part1">View pictures on Picasa</a> </div>
