I'm almost up to date again! <p />&nbsp;I had a bit of a wander around Granville Island on Saturday (scarcely <br />a proper island, really), which is a bit touristy but has some nice <br />produce and stuff.  And some good coffee if you luck into the right <br />place. <p />&nbsp;Sunday was a bit more interesting; a boating trip around Indian Arm, <br />which is a bit of an inlet off the main inlet, I suppose.  Getting a <br />temporary boating licence is apparently as easy as signing a piece of <br />paper!  Unfortunately, a lot of the pictures were taken while the boat <br />was moving, so were at best very blurry and for the most-part also <br />captured mostly sky or boat floor.  You'll just have to take my word <br />on how spectacular it is! <p />&nbsp;The second picture is a corner of Stanley park, with the sea wall <br />going around the edge -- I plan on running or cycling that at some <br />stage; it's around 12km I think.  That yellow mound is sulfur <br />apparently: lots of industrial action on the way there. <p />&nbsp;(Oh yes, and I went to the night markets on Friday night, and yes <br />they're exactly the same as night markets everywhere else).
