Last weekend's notable excursion: I went for a walk around the seawall, which is a roughly 10km path (mostly separated into pedestrian and cycle/roller-bladers) around Stanley Park: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawall_%28Vancouver%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawall_%28Vancouver%29</a> <p />&nbsp;The weather was a bit overcast, but it's a pretty nice walk. The pictures probably don't need much explanation. The first 6 were taken on the first km or two, around Canada Place. The rock on the corner (#8) is Siwash Rock. I'm not sure who the guy in the penultimate photo is, but he was taking great care balancing a lot of rocks :) Then I met up with some friends and hung out in and around the International Jazz Festival that's on at the moment. <p />&nbsp;A nice and cruisey weekend, not that news-worthy sorry.<ol>
