<p>I'd only briefly passed through Vancouver's Gastown area in my last visit, so I had an afternoon walk through with a friend this trip. As I understand it, it's one of those areas that started off a bit rough, became a bit of a bohemian haunt and inevitably trendy, and is now a moderately touristy area with boutique shopping, etc. You can probably picture areas in your own location that have gone through a similar transformation; Salamanca in Hobart springs to mind. Pleasant walking though. It's rather amusingly right next to the really dodgy area of Vancouver too, through which you have to cross to get to Chinatown (photos coming).</p>
