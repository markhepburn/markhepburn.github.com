title: Random Observations from the Nepal Himalaya
published: true
---
<p>As most of you reading this probably know, I spent October in Nepal, mostly trekking in the Himalaya. &nbsp;I have honestly been dreaming of this for... I'm not going to think about it for fear of divulging my age (since high-school anyway), and it exceeded even those expectations! &nbsp;I promise photos are coming soon, but in the mean time here's a few random observations.</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Nepal is the most mountainous country in the world: everything is up-hill. &nbsp;"Flat" means "uphill", and even descending still involves a substantial amount of climbing.</li>
<li>No other country, I am convinced, makes you feel more inadequate, or less of a man. &nbsp;While you are gasping as you struggle up a small hill, porters that look to weigh less than 60kg will trot past you while carrying an obscenely heavy and awkward load, while whistling. &nbsp;Officially, they carry no more than 30kg; in reality, they often carry double that in order to receive a double wage. &nbsp;Apparently they can also drink you under the table (all I can&nbsp;attest&nbsp;to is their eating prowess). 
<ul>
<li>We saw a boy, probably about 16 but looking more like 12, carrying a double load (2 x 30kg bags of rice).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'd always wondered what the altitude would "feel" like; I'd assumed that the air would somehow feel thinner. &nbsp;It doesn't, and most of the time you don't even notice it. &nbsp;It's just that as soon as you&nbsp;exert&nbsp;yourself in the slightest you feel incredibly unfit.</li>
<li>The scale of place is so vast, so absolutely massive in every direction, that it is near-impossible to get any idea of scale. &nbsp;As you look out out over a valley which plunges hundreds of metres down sheer walls, and is capped on the other side by snow-covered mountains that rise for several kilometres up <em>again</em>, the resulting vista seems almost two-dimensional. 
<ul>
<li>Along these lines, in every view of Everest you are likely to see it will probably appear tiny next to the neighbouring Nuptse (at 7861m, actually about a full km shorter).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Before going I had read&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/travel/21nepal.html">this piece on the Annapurna region</a>, and I was particularly taken by this bit: "<em>Everyone who's been to Nepal tells you the Himalayas are big. &nbsp;But nobody prepared me for the reality of breathing hard at altitudes already near those of some Rocky Mountain peaks, only to see a mountain rise another full height of the Rockies above me"</em>. &nbsp;Yep, it's like that. &nbsp;I live at sea-level but am blessed to have a&nbsp;1271m&nbsp;"mountain" right on my door-step, which really does dominate the skyline and city. &nbsp;Now, imagine doubling that by stacking it on top of itself, then double <em>that</em> resulting stack again: that's what you're looking up at all day (ok, only a 3-stack by the end of the trek), and you're already struggling to move faster than a snail's pace because of your own altitude.</li>
<li>A low-protein mostly-carbohydrate vegetarian diet makes Mark very skinny indeed. &nbsp;I could feel that I was losing a lot of weight, and the airport scales in Lukla as we were leaving&nbsp;confirmed it&nbsp;(not to mention my gaunt torso when I finally had access to a mirror back in Kathmandu): 8kg down! &nbsp;In fact, I think it was actually more like <em>10kg</em> and those scales were wrong, which we suspected anyway after the smallest member of our party had apparently gained weight; for the next week and a bit I ate like a demon trying to recover the deficit, yet when I got home to scales I knew I was still down 8kg.</li>
</ul>
<div>It is honestly the most stunning scenery I have ever seen. &nbsp;I apologise in advance for my photos, which don't do it any justice (it will be no surprise to most of you that I took a lot of panoramas, mainly just trying to capture the scale).</div>
