After nearly 3 months it was almost time to head back home and to the
real world again, but there was one thing remaining... road trip!  The
third member of our
[friends from Patagonia]({% post_url 2014-03-18-north-america-2013-old-friends-in-la-news-ones-in-yosemite %}),
Dan, had been out of the country and I'd missed catching up with him,
but things would finally work out: he had a meeting on the Colorado /
Arizona border and was going to drive there, and I had a few days
left.  Perfect!

I flew back to Ontario airport (I'd learned my lesson about LAX),
Kevin picked me up again and we met up with Dan for one final meal
together before Dan and I hit the road for a late assault on Las
Vegas.

Vegas had never been on my itinerary.  Based purely on impressions, it
seemed like a place that might be fun with the right crew, but flying
solo it held little appeal for me.  I *was* still curious though, so
after we checked in around midnight I didn't require much urging to go
for a wander up the strip.  It is absolutely quite a sight, to say
nothing of the human spectacle with girls flicking cards in your face
to attract attention and nightclub touts every 15 metres ("Gentlemen!
No cover charge tonight...  we got drunk chicks inside").

That was to be the extent of my Vegas experience though!  All of about
8 hours, and most of them asleep.  The next morning we were on the
road again, bound for
[Zion National Park](http://www.nps.gov/zion/index.htm).  We arrived
at the town of Springdale in late afternoon, so we kept going for a
short drive into the park.  This was also the first time I really
"understood" this type of scenery.  I am used to admiring lush or
snow-covered mountains, rain forest scenery, and so on---but when
everyone I talked to kept raving about all the "red rock" parks I
didn't really get it.  Sure, the rock formations looked cool, but how
much of it did you really need to see?  Well, standing there in the
middle of it, with enormous red sandstone cliffs and formations eroded
into being over thousands of years, in colours more vivid than any
photograph can ever convey, I did understand why.  I was definitely
looking forward to exploring properly the next day.

The light was going down though so we headed back to
Springdale... only to discover that the hotel we'd booked was
actually located on the other side of the park!  So, back through that
road for a third time, with the people at the gate giving us strange
looks.

Over dinner that night I learned that not only does (Mormon) Utah
actually have at least one brewery, but they have a sense of humour
about it: I washed my food down with a Polygamy Porter.

The following morning we again drove that rode through the park for a
fourth time, saying good morning to our friends at the gate, and
parked at the visitor centre to investigate hikes before catching a
shuttle in.  We had planned to explore Hidden Canyon, but when that
was closed off not far from the entrance we took another path winding
up to Observation Point, with glorious views back over the main canyon
and river.

My penultimate full day had us take a fifth and final trip through the
park, and head along the Arizona border towards Lake Powell.  We
didn't have time to see
[Rainbow Arch](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=rainbow+arch+lake+powell&tbm=isch),
but the boat tour through the lake's canyons was still striking.
Sunset over Horseshoe Bend was even more spectacular (and put Grand
Canyon firmly on my list for my next trip, when you realise this
enormous bend was a fraction the size of those in Grand Canyon!)

Hitting the road for the final time together, we drove through
Monument Valley---an expanse of
[mesas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa) and
[buttes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte) that looks just like
every cowboy movie you've seen, because that is indeed where they were
all filmed---towards the tiny town of Durango in Colorado.  Dan's
friends there showered us with hospitality, and in the morning even
took me on a short hike in the hills.  I was really sorry not to have
more time in Colorado; mountains still draw me, and there's a lot to
explore there.

Unfortunately, it wasn't going to happen this trip, for that was the
end.  Dan drove me to the airport, and I began my 32-hour, 6-flight
(of which I had to sprint for 3!), return voyage.

# Èl Fin, Un Comienzo

I always pictured writing some final paragraph with my favourite
places and memories, but in reality I don't think I could separate
much.  I will pick out
[Alberta]({% post_url 2013-12-27-stunning-alberta %})
as my favourite outdoors experience, but
[Yosemite]({% post_url 2014-03-18-north-america-2013-old-friends-in-la-news-ones-in-yosemite %})
and Zion were both very different and equally spectacular.
[New York]({% post_url 2014-01-18-north-america-2013-new-york %})
was great, [Portland]({% post_url 2014-04-21-north-america-2013-pacific-north-west %})
was too for very different reasons... but again, there were very few
places I wouldn't gladly revisit and a long list of places I still
intend to but couldn't this time.

As always of course the people made the most difference---so to
everyone I met, old and new, and invited back to my home-town... I was
serious, come visit!

This post effectively marks the end of this blog as a place for my
travel pictures.[^1]

As I mentioned at
[the beginning]({% post_url 2013-12-22-north-america-2013-back-to-vancouver %}),
I quit my job before this trip, and together with a friend I'm now
well into [something new](http://www.condense.com.au).  That means
much less travel-posts for now, but on the other hand I do have a long
list of posts in technical and business areas I plan to write.  Stay
tuned!  (Or update your subscriptions accordingly)

[^1]: It was originally a means for people to keep track of where I
    was, but given the delays in recent posts it didn't do that very well.
