Well, I initially set this up as a kind of travel blog to keep people posted on what I&#39;d been up to.  Said travels have now finished, so either this just winds up, or I keep posting but in a different direction.  If the latter though, expect emacs to be involved fairly frequently, sorry [[posterous-content:TlSQBz4IEoW0xr6NTZrG]]  (especially now that <a href="http://posterous.com/">posterous</a> -- which I use to host this -- can embed <a href="http://gist.github.com/">gist</a> urls!)<p /> If you have any alternative suggestions then of course let me know.  I also have seriously itchy feet now, so if I end up scratching those any time soon I&#39;ll presumably use the same forum for those stories!
