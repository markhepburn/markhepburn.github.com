A bit over a year ago I <a href="http://blog.everythingtastesbetterwithchilli.com/2009/06/11/around-the-edges-of-wwdc-techno-porn/">attended a lunch time talk</a> at WWDC&#39;09, on recovering the &quot;lost&quot; images from the Lunar Orbiter of the 60s before it was too late.<p /> At the time it blew my mind, and it still does. Â By a happy coincidence I&#39;ve just found the slides from that presentation online:<br /><iframe marginheight="0" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/1576315" marginwidth="0" frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe>
