Man Vancouver is pretty! We had spectacular weather for my first day here too; heaps of sun, and about mid-20s in temperature I think. Sherman picked me up in the morning along with some friends (for those of you who don't know, Sherman is the main programmer I'll be collaborating with at UBC, and has been a great help in getting me set up over here -- and for those of you who are Sherman, many thanks :)) and gave me a driving tour, stopping for a bit in Stanley Park (first couple of pictures). We spent most of the afternoon on Kits beach (including a Capoeira display, pictured), and at the end of the day walked back around the waterfront (token sunset and beach shots). Great day. Great city.
