If you use Emacs, then perhaps surprisingly one of the best places to
hang out is the
[Google+ Emacs community](https://plus.google.com/communities/114815898697665598016).

You also may or may not be aware of the
[calc](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/calc.html)
facility embedded in Emacs.  It seems to be one of the lesser-known
features, and even among those who do know about it, many are unaware
how sophisticated it is.  You can invoke it with `M-x calc`, or `C-x *
*` and at first glance it seems quite primitive... until you read the
manual, at which point it can instead seem impenetrable!

Hidden underneath the spartan, stack-based interface is matrix and
vector arithmetic, date and time calculations, unit-aware calculations
and conversion, symbolic manipulation, and on it goes.

Nearly a year ago [Andrew Hyatt](http://google.com/+AndrewHyatt)
posted a series of tutorials that explored a lot of the corners, but
one of the weaknesses of Google+ is that content can be hard to
aggregate or find again.

So, when I remembered the other day I went back and dug up all the
ones I could find, in order to provide a pointer back to them!  Just
as I was completing the list I discovered that there is already
[one archive](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Calc_Tutorials_by_Andrew_Hyatt)
on the [EmacsWiki](http://www.emacswiki.org), but one more is
certainly not going to hurt discoverability.

# The Tutorials
