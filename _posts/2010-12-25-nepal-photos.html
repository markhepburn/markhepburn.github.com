....are coming soon, I promise! I've just been doing the initial <br />cull, so I can start posting shortly (I think I'll batch them, grouped <br />by day or by trek segment). <p /> In the mean time, while you're eagerly waiting may I suggest you check <br />out other people's photos, from the same trip: <p /> <a href="http://paulmcc.posterous.com/nepal">http://paulmcc.posterous.com/nepal</a> (or, "Around the Himalaya in 15 <br />photos"). Paul was one of my travel companions. <p /> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/100595625918224912002/NepalHike2010#">http://picasaweb.google.com/100595625918224912002/NepalHike2010#</a> Matt <br />both had a much better camera, and is a vastly better photographer <br />than me, so really you don't need to check back here after looking at <br />his (also, his trek was slightly more extensive). Matt was doing <br />essentially the same itinerary as us so we kept bumping into him, and <br />he ended up joining us for a few days when his other trek buddies had <br />to leave. I'm actually in a couple of those shots, for those who <br />don't believe I was really there!
