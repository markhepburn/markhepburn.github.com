I caught the cable car up to Chinatown (first photo is of them manually turning the car!), and had a walk around Russian Hill and down Lombard St (the "crookedest street in the world"). (I also walked around Fisherman's wharf and along the Embarcadero, but there wasn't much worth photographing there). That's Alcatraz in the second-last picture. <p />&nbsp;Also, I face-planted at the top of Lombard St, when I caught my foot jumping off a vantage point. Go me. (This may have evened up my karma after I got upgraded to premium economy on the flight over! Boy is that worth it).<ol>
